   ```

2. **Execute the SQL file**:
   ```sql
   \i sample-appdev-data.sql
   ```

### Option 3: Using pgAdmin

1. Open pgAdmin
2. Connect to your database
3. Open the Query Tool
4. Load and execute `sample-appdev-data.sql`

- **30 Students** with realistic Filipino names and addresses
- **4 Assessments** with AppDev-related content
- **16 Sub-Assessments** with detailed instructions
- **480 Student Submissions** (30 students √ó 16 sub-assessments)
- **432 Graded Submissions** (90% completion rate)
- **376 Passing Grades** (87% pass rate)

## üé® Sample Student Names

The data includes 30 students with realistic names:

4. **Click on any assessment**
5. **View the sub-assessments with progress bars**

Each sub-assessment card will show:
- **Student Grading Progress** (e.g., "75% Complete (20/27 students)")
- **Visual progress bar** with green fill
- **Status** (Not Started, In Progress, Half Complete, Completed)

## üßπ Cleaning Up Sample Data

To remove the sample data:

```sql
-- Remove sample data (be careful!)
DELETE FROM sub_assessment_submissions WHERE sub_assessment_id IN (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016);
DELETE FROM sub_assessments WHERE sub_assessment_id IN (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016);
DELETE FROM assessments WHERE assessment_id IN (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004);
DELETE FROM course_enrollments WHERE enrollment_id BETWEEN 1001 AND 1030;
DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id BETWEEN 1001 AND 1030;
DELETE FROM ilos WHERE ilo_id BETWEEN 1001 AND 1004;
DELETE FROM section_courses WHERE section_course_id = 1001;
DELETE FROM syllabi WHERE syllabus_id = 1001;
DELETE FROM courses WHERE course_id = 1001;
```

## üìù Notes

- All sample data uses IDs starting from 1001 to avoid conflicts
- The data is realistic and relevant to Application Development
- Progress bars will show actual grading completion rates
- Students have varying performance levels to simulate real scenarios
- All dates are set for the 2024-2025 academic year

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. **Check database connection** - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. **Verify database name** - Make sure `crms_v2_db` exists
3. **Check permissions** - Ensure your user has INSERT privileges
4. **Review error messages** - Look for specific constraint violations
