# Faculty Assignment Process - Enhanced Database Creation

## Overview

When a faculty member is assigned to a course, the system now automatically creates a comprehensive set of database structures to support the assessment framework. This ensures that faculty have everything they need to start working immediately.

## Process Flow

### 1. Faculty Assignment Trigger
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/section-courses/assign-instructor`
- **Trigger**: When `instructor_id` is assigned to a `section_course_id`
- **Transaction**: All operations are wrapped in a database transaction for data integrity

### 2. Automatic Database Structure Creation

#### A. Draft Syllabus Creation
```sql
INSERT INTO syllabi (
  section_course_id, title, description, assessment_framework, 
  grading_policy, course_outline, learning_resources, prerequisites,
  course_objectives, version, is_template, created_by, review_status, approval_status
)
```

**Generated Fields:**
- **title**: `{Course Title} - {Section Code}`
- **assessment_framework**: JSONB with course-specific assessment structure
- **grading_policy**: JSONB with default grading rules
- **status**: `draft` (ready for faculty customization)

#### B. Intelligent Assessment Framework Generation

The system analyzes the course title to determine the appropriate assessment structure:

**Programming/Development Courses:**
```json
{
  "assessment_structure": [
    {
      "type": "Quiz",
      "count": 5,
      "weight_per_assessment": 8,
      "total_weight": 40,
      "ilo_coverage": ["ILO1", "ILO2"]
    },
    {
      "type": "Project",
      "count": 2,
      "weight_per_assessment": 20,
      "total_weight": 40,
      "ilo_coverage": ["ILO1", "ILO2", "ILO3"]
    },
    {
      "type": "Final Exam",
      "count": 1,
      "weight_per_assessment": 20,
      "total_weight": 20,
      "ilo_coverage": ["ILO1", "ILO2", "ILO3", "ILO4"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Research/Thesis Courses:**
```json
{
  "assessment_structure": [
    {
      "type": "Literature Review",
      "count": 1,
      "weight_per_assessment": 20,
      "total_weight": 20
    },
    {
      "type": "Research Proposal",
      "count": 1,
      "weight_per_assessment": 25,
      "total_weight": 25
    },
    {
      "type": "Final Paper",
      "count": 1,
      "weight_per_assessment": 40,
      "total_weight": 40
    },
    {

      "weight_per_assessment": 15,
      "total_weight": 15
    }
  ]
}
```

**Default Courses:**

    },
    {
      "type": "Assignment",
      "count": 4,
      "weight_per_assessment": 12.5,
      "total_weight": 50
    },
    {

      "count": 1,
      "weight_per_assessment": 20,
      "total_weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

#### C. Default Grading Policy
```json
{
  "late_submission_policy": {
    "1-7 days": 10,
    "8-14 days": 20,
    "15+ days": 50
  },
  "attendance_policy": {
    "required": true,
    "weight": 5,
    "max_absences": 3
  },
  "participation_policy": {
    "weight": 5,
    "criteria": ["Class participation", "Group work", "Discussions"]
  },
  "academic_integrity": {
    "plagiarism": "Zero tolerance",
    "cheating": "Immediate failure",
    "collaboration": "As specified per assignment"
  }
}
```

#### D. Intelligent ILO Generation
